## Table of contents and brief description of dataset files 

### 1.	Bathymetric data (in netCDF format)

The bathymetric data correspond to a mesh that spans 10,000 m along the channel and 400 m across the channel, with a 1 m x 1 m spatial resolution. This data covers the area from the river mouth to 10 km upstream.

    a.	HDS_BAT.nc
    b.	MDS_BAT.nc
    c.	LDS_BAT.nc

HDS, MDS, and LDS refer to High, Mean, and Low freshwater Discharge Scenarios. The paper provides more details on the scenarios.

### 2.	Processed field data

    a.	Output figures from the Bedforms ATM v1.2 software on selected longitudinal profiles through the bathymetric data used to calculate the geometric fields.

    b.	Geometric fields (in netCDF format) for each hydrological and location scenario. 

        i.	HDS_SA.nc
        ii. HDS_SB.nc
        iii. MDS_SA.nc
        iv. MDS_SB.nc
        v. LDS_SA.nc
        vi. LDS_SB.nc

SA and SB refer to the analyzed Sectors in the Magdalena River Estuary: A and B. The paper provides more details on the sectors.
